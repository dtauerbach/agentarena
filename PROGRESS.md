# PROGRESS

## Status right now

- W0 + W1 done; W2 code-complete, live acceptance pending an API key.
- Web app at http://localhost:$PORT: dashboard, experiment pages, launch
  (mock or anthropic-with-confirm), live paced SSE viewer with speed/pause/
  step/hold + operator panel, replay of finished runs.
- `npm run check` green (45 unit tests); `npx playwright test` green (2 e2e).
- Headless: `npm run sim -- run experiments/nogame/A_baseline.yaml --provider
  mock --duration 600`; live runs print an estimate and enforce
  ARENA_BUDGET_USD (default 5, `--yes` to override).
- **Blocked on operator**: W2 acceptance (live 900 s watched run ending with
  cost shown) needs `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env.local`.
- Next: W3 — gate wakes, chat revision, mention notifications, remaining
  knobs, YAML editor, full nogame catalog.

## Decisions

- Live runs are guarded twice: UI checkbox confirm with an estimate (and a
  second explicit checkbox when over budget); same guard in the sim script
  via --yes. Estimate math follows SPEC §12.
- The engine is paced by an injectable Pacer (speed/pause/step); live runs
  and file replays stream through the same SSE viewer. Finished live
  sessions drop out of the registry so reopening a run is a true replay.
- Events carry two operator-panel extras beyond SPEC §9: wake events include
  the call's token usage; silence/post/skipped events include next_wake.
- Anthropic provider uses SDK maxRetries 4 (five attempts) for its
  429/5xx backoff, then the engine logs provider_error and continues.

- Pivoted CLI-first → web-first (operator request, 2026-09-10). Harness renamed
  `arena`; nogame is experiment #1 in `experiments/nogame/`; docs split into
  docs/SPEC.md (harness) + docs/experiments/nogame.md (idea + catalog).
- Biome, not Prettier: global sandbox standards win where the project had no
  reason to deviate. Same for `src/` Next.js layout; tests sit next to source.
- No SQLite/Drizzle: configs and run artifacts are plain files by hard rule 5.
- Added `render.you_are_line` template ("You are {name}.") — SPEC §4 listed it
  as a literal, but hard rule 2 requires every agent-visible string to be a
  template in YAML.
- Ticks-mode wait = tick × (1 + Geometric(p)) so a wake is always ≥1 tick out;
  sampled first wakes use tick × Geometric(p) and may hit tick 0.
- RNG draws happen while resolving batch results in wake-time order (not
  pre-drawn before launch as SPEC §3 words it) — same schedule determinism,
  verified by the byte-identical-runs test.
- Mock provider appends a NEXT line only when the instruction block mentions
  NEXT (i.e. check_back is on), so baseline posts aren't polluted.
- Gate wakes, chat revision, and mention notifications are W3; the engine
  fails fast with a clear error if a config asks for them early.
- Auto agent names are A..Z in order (unseeded); explicit name lists are used
  in order. Cap 26 for auto.
- viewer.port dropped from the schema (the Next app owns the port);
  viewer.speed kept for the W1 viewer.
- Model id verified 2026-09-10: `claude-haiku-4-5` ($1/$5 per MTok, cache
  write 1.25/read 0.10) in base.yaml + pricing.yaml.
- OASIS borrow (SPEC §17): per-tick activation probability, do-nothing as an
  action, simultaneous-within-a-step visibility, seeded application order.
  No code or deps taken; their feed/action scaffolding conflicts with rule 2.

## Changelog

- 2026-09-10: doc pivot + restructure; Next scaffold (Biome/Tailwind/shadcn,
  vitest, tsx); W0 engine + tests green; acceptance run produces
  board/events/calls JSONL. Commits: docs pivot, scaffold, w0.
- 2026-09-10: W1 web shell (dashboard, launcher, paced SSE viewer, replay,
  Playwright e2e). W2 anthropic provider + pricing + estimate + budget
  guard + operator panel; live acceptance deferred until a key exists.
